          <p>Bot interactions are another important yet challenging task in the field of blockchain to utilize machine learning. Chatbots are an integral part of AI and these can work even more securely when combined with Blockchain. In big companies like Samsung, bot interaction i.e. human-bot as well as bot-bot interaction are mainly used for managing finance precisely. Chatbot assitant, insurance service delivery systems, and Blockchain digital identification are some of the main works bots perform under Blockchain and AI integration.</p>

<p>Supply Chain logistics is another important area of work where Blockchain and ML come into contact to make it a better model. It is an associate method where the raw materials is converted into finished products and are delivered to direct to customers or first to retailers and then to customers. As understood, first step in making products in any field requires to understand consumer needs. This results in generating enormous amount of data which is stored in databases inside clouds. This information is divided into numerous servers, which increases the security levels as accessibility becomes less. ML plays a primary role in formulating great sources of information with the help of Blockchain Technology BT.</p>

          <h2>Permissioned Blockchain</h2> 

          <p>BT grew up through Bitcoin cryptocurrency where the transactions can be done from any end i.e. from any node without any permission. Permissioned blockchain came into existence when business enterprises started to commute information on a common platform in assured and personalized manner. Need of permissioned blockchain arised due to the fact that their is no restrictions in Bitcoin and any information can be used by anyone in any way be it positive or negative. Their are some of the components of permissioned blockchain that makes it more strong and easy to use:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Shared Ledger</li>
Shared Ledger is a type of allocated system where all the peers in network has the track of all the transactions going on in the network. This reduces the frauds that may happen in a simple bitcoin system due to lack of security. 
<li>Peer Network </li>

This network provides a more safe environment to work in as the transactions validated by the peers add to the block. No invalid transaction is made in a block as transactions added in a block are unaltered and irreplaceable. 

    <li>Certificate Authority</li> 
Not all the users get the opportunity to enter the blockchain transactions. Every user needs to ask for a permission from the Membership Authority. After proper authentication, they gives the users right to access the transactions and get included in the blockchain. 

    <li>Smart Contract</li>
This basically defines the software running on the shared as well as personal ledger. This creates the learning model using blockchain technology, machine learning models and artificial intelligence. It is a digitized form of contract which monetizes skill-sets of machine learning algorithms. 
          </ol>
<p>Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology works together mostly for the prediction of certain models which helps to analyze them correctly and makes the right decision. Machine Learning merely predicts the bitcoin prices through bayesian regression. The factors which works are total bitcoins, trade volume, day high, number of transaction, and block size. The data set is usually trained using box-cox normalization, z-score and log techniques. The practical administration of these theoretical principles has been done on numerous cryptocurrency like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash and of course Bitcoin.</p>
